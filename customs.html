Names
  

Greeting 
  When meeting for the first time, or entering conversation, speakers should introduce themselves. 
  Use the Initial tense to state your global index (Only if I decide this language should include
  global indexing/identification) and given/common name. 
  Optionally, state other names such as middle names, family names, past names, or usernames. 
  Other speakers then should agree on a local index for your Agent. This might be a number, 
  or any combination of your stated names.
    eg  (This is not well defined yet. Sorry).
