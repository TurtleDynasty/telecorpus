Grammar - Tenses. 

Telecorpus has four tenses. 

Initial 
  This happens only once, or is an event that precedes all others in a process. 
    eg  implantation of technology under the skin, purchase of a pice of equipment,
        creation of a tattoo. 

Continual 
  This happens constantly by its nature. 
    eg  An ear is always hearing; it does not turn off. 

Conditional 
  This happens only if some prior state occurs. 
    eg  The door opens after you insert the key. 

Habitual 
  This happens frequently, only when an agent has elected to take action. 
  Or as in an automatic response to a specific stimulus. 
    eg  Smartphone notifications, using a button for data entry, checking a watch,
        event-based response from a computer. 

How these are conjugated and notated is a work in progress. 
  The phonetic rules are not yet defined. 
  The written rules are in progress and going to use elements of Message Sequence Diagrams. 

====================

Grammar - "Sentences." 

One should avoid using terms like "sentence" when describing telecorpus. As its primary 
writing system is a Messge Sequence Diagram, the use of the Conditional tense may prouduce a
branching structure that cannot be easily described in a single "sentence." 
Therefore, we use some other labels for utterances to differentiate between an utterance that is 
ending for now, leaving the full "sentence" partially conplete, and a series of utterances that
collectively make up a full "sentence."

Run
  As much information as can be expressed linearly in a single utterance. 

Sequence
  One or more Runs which together start at one definite point and end at one or more others,
  with no further utterances needed to complete this "sentence."

Diagram
  One or more Sequences which describe a process with a conceptual label, such as a biological 
  system, series of events in a story, or set of transactions related to one event. 

The need for this system will become clear once you are familiar with telecorpus' primary writing
system, which is currently in development. 

====================

Grammar - Parts of Speech. 

Agent 
  The initiator, processor, or reciever of a message. 
  In formal linguistic terms, telecorpus Agents are "agent" and "patient." 
    eg  self, a body part, a computer, other people. 

Message 
  The information transmitted by an agent to another agent. 
  In telecorpus, there are no verbs. Or rather there is only one verb, "message." 
  How the message is sent, what it contains, and where it goes is described in three parts. 

    Means 
      The means by which a message is transmitted. 
        eg  by language, by visible light, by touch, by physical action. 
 
    Class
      The type of information being carried. 
      In formal linguistic terms, telecorpus Classes are "direct objects of a ditransitive verb." 
        eg  money, language, color, food, drug. 

    Depth
      The conceptual depth into which the message is meant to be delivered. As in, a location. 
      This location is different from a "patient" Agent. It is more like the location of the Agent. 
      When the Initial tense is used to state the location of an indexed Agent in advance, 
      Depth can be dropped from a Sequence in the Continual, Conditional, or Habirual tenses.
