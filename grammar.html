<h2> Grammar </h2>
<h3> Tenses </h3>
<p> Telecorpus has five (or maybe four) tenses. </p>

<h4> Initial </h4>
<p> This happens only once, or is an event that precedes all others in a process. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> eg  implantation of technology under the skin, purchase of a pice of equipment,
        creation of a tattoo. 
      </p>

<h4> Continual </h4>
<p> This happens constantly by its nature. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> eg  An ear is always hearing; it does not turn off. 
</p>

<h4> Conditional </h4>
<p> This happens only if some prior state occurs, as in an automatic response to a specific stimulus. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> eg  The door opens only after you insert the key. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> Note to self: Should I include logical operators to facilitate this? 
                  If so, should I eleminate this tense?
</p>

<h4> Habitual </h4>
<p> This happens frequently, only when an agent has elected to take action. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> eg  Smartphone notifications, using a button for data entry, checking a watch. 
</p>

<h4> Hypothetical </h4>
<p> This happens hypothetically, as in asking a question, or making an assertion about the future.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> eg  Does it work this way? Will it work this way? I wonder if it will work this way...? 
</p>

<p> Note: How these are conjugated and marked is a work in progress. 
      The phonetic and orthographic rules are a work in progress. 
</p>


<h3> "Sentences" </h3>

<p> One should avoid using terms like "sentence" when describing telecorpus. As its primary 
writing system is a Messge Sequence Diagram, the use of the Conditional tense (or maybe 
logical operators?) may prouduce a branching structure that cannot be easily described 
in a single "sentence." Therefore, we use some other labels for utterances to differentiate 
between an utterance that is ending for now, leaving the full "sentence" partially conplete, 
and a series of utterances that collectively make up a full "sentence."
</p>

<h4> Run </h4>
<p> A linear expression, a streak of utterance. </p>
  <p style="text-indent: 2em;"> eg  Alice gives a key to Bob. </p>

<h4> Sequence </h4>
<p> One or more Runs, which together start at one or more definite points 
  and end at one or more others, with no further utterances needed to complete this "sentence."
</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 2em;"> eg  Alice gives a key to Bob, who gives the key to David, who uses the key to unlock the door.
  </p>

<h4> Diagram </h4>
<p> One or more Sequences which describe a process with a conceptual label, such as a biological 
  system, series of events in a setting, or set of transactions related to one system of events. 
</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 2em;"> eg  Let us explain how keys are used to open things.
        Alice gives a key to Bob, who gives the key to David, who uses the key to unlock the door.
        Xavier gives a key to Yolanda, who gives it to Zack, who uses it to unlock the box.
        Now we are done explaining how keys are used to open things. 
  </p>

<h4> Set </h4>
<p> One or more Diagrams desribing a high-level entity or subject, a collective.
<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> eg  Let us explain how keys are used to open things.
        Alice gives a key to Bob, who gives the key to David, who uses the key to unlock the door.
        Xavier gives a key to Yolanda, who gives it to Zack, who uses it to unlock the box.
        Now we are done explaining how keys are used to open things. 
        Let us explain how dogs are fed.
        David gives the food to the bowl. David gives the bowl to the dog. 
        The dog takes the food from the bowl. The dog digests the food.
        Now we are done explaining how dogs are fed. 
        Now we are done explaining what things David does (opening doors and feeding dogs).
        Now it is your turn to speak.
      </p>

<p> This grammar feels clunky and awkward when you use it with English words. 
The need for this system will become clear once you are familiar with telecorpus' primary writing
system, which is currently in development. This regularularity is an ecumberance to speech, but 
a significant advantage to formalizing models of information flow with clarity and precision.
I don't think any natural languages do this. I'm a Computer Scientist. Sorry.
</p>

<h3> Parts of Speech </h3>

<h4> Agent </h4> 
<p> The initiator, processor, or reciever of a message. 
</p>
<p> In formal linguistic terms, telecorpus Agents are "agent" and "patient." 
</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 2em;"> eg  self, a body part, a computer, other people. 
  </p>

<h4> Message </h4>
<p> The information transmitted by an agent to another agent. 
</p>
<p> In telecorpus, there are no verbs. Or rather there is only one verb, "send message." 
  How the message is sent, what it contains, and where it goes is described in three parts. 
</p>

    <h5> Means </h5>
      <p> The means by which a message is transmitted. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;"> eg  by language, by visible light, by touch, by physical action. 
        </p>
 
    <h5> Class </h5>
      <p> The type of information being carried. 
      </p>
      <p> In formal linguistic terms, telecorpus Classes are "direct objects of a ditransitive verb." 
      </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;"> eg  money, language, color, food, drug. 
        </p> 

    <h5> Depth </h5>
      <p> The conceptual depth into which the message is meant to be delivered. As in, a location. 
      </p>
      <p> This location is different from a "patient" Agent. It is more like the location of the Agent. 
      When the Initial tense is used to explicitly state the location of an Agent in advance, 
      Depth can be dropped from a Sequence in the other tenses. 
      </p>
