Phonemes. 

This is not defined yet. Sorry. 
I have two goals here. 
One goal is to use sounds that in English (or my dialect of it), reflect expressive interjections. 
  eg Suppose "ba" = voiced bilabial plosive [b] open vowel [a]. Then "bababa" means talking. As in the English interjection "blah blah blah."
The other goal is to restrict the sounds used in the language to a set that can be learned more easily by people from different backgrounds. 
  eg This language should not have that awful consonant cluster in Esperanto that stops me from being able to remember how to speak it. 
     (Esperanto uses both voiced and unvoiced alveolar affricate, alvelolar fricative, post-alveolar affricate, and post-alvelolar fricative. In my opinion, it's too many similar sounds.) 
     (English also has all of these sounds (I think), and I cannot fathom how I ever learned to say them all. This should not exist.)
