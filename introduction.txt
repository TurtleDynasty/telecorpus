Introduction. 

Telecorpus is a constructed language to describe body modification, cybernetic implants, medical devices, and accessibility technology. 
It is more regular than natural languages (citation needed) and uses a specific grammar and vocabulary to describe just the things it needs to. 
Telecorpus is not general-purpose and not an international auxiliary language, though some considerations have been made to facilitate easier learning by people from different backgrounds. 

All aspects of this language are still under construction. You might come back and find things have changed. Sorry. 

This language is under development by David Miller aka TurtleDynasty. If you have questions or comments, please tweet @TurtleDynasty.
