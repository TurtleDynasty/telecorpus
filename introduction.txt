Introduction. 

Telecorpus is a constructed language to describe body modification, cybernetic implants, 
medical devices, and accessibility technology. 
It is more regular than natural languages (citation needed). 
Its grammar is tailored for modeling information flow as a Message Sequence Diagram, 
and uses such a diagraming technique in its othography. 
Its vocabulary is highly classifying, but not highly specific.

Although some considerations have been made to facilitate easier learning by people from 
different backgrounds, it is probably not suitable for a general-purpose international language. 

All aspects of this language are still under construction. 
You might come back later and find things have changed. Sorry.
